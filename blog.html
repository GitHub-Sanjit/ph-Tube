                <p>VAR :</p>

                    <li>
                        <span>Scope : </span>
                        Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means that their scope is limited to the
                        function in which they are declared.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Hoisting : </span>
                        var is hoisted to the top of its scope, which means that you can use the variable before it's
                        declared, but it will be undefined until the declaration is encountered in the code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Reassignment : </span> var allows for redeclaration within the same scope.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>LET :</p>
                <ul class="text-sm list-disc ml-4 my-4">
                    <li>
                        <span>Block Scope : </span>
                        Variables declared with let are block-scoped. This means that their scope is limited to the
                        block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are declared.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span> Hoisting : </span>
                        let is hoisted to the top of its block, but unlike var, it is not initialized until the actual
                        declaration is encountered.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span> Reassignment : </span>
                        let does not allow for redeclaration within the same scope, but it allows for reassignment.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>CONST :</p>
                <ul class="text-sm list-disc ml-4 my-4">
                    <li>
                        <span> Block Scope : </span>
                        Variables declared with const are also block-scoped.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span> Hoisting : </span>
                        Like let, const is hoisted to the top of its block but not initialized until the actual
                        declaration is encountered.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span> Reassignment : </span>
                        const variables must be initialized at the time of declaration, and their values cannot be
                        reassigned.

                        <span>Intentional Absence of value :</span>
                        It is a deliberate assignment to a variable or an object property to signify that it has no
                        value or is explicitly empty.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                                <span>Explicitly Absence of values :</span>
                                null is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property has no
                                assigned value or that a function returns no meaningful result.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Resetting Variable Values :</span>
                                Setting a variable to null can be a way to reset its value or indicate that it should
                                not be used in its current state.
                            </li>

                    <li>
                        <span>Default Value for Uninitialized Variables:</span>
                        Variables that are declared but not assigned a value are automatically initialized with
                        undefined.

                                Accessing an object property that is not defined results in undefined.

                                If a function is called with fewer arguments than the number of parameters it expects,
                                the missing parameters are set to undefined.

                                If a function does not explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns undefined.

                What do you mean by REST API?

                <p>REST API :</p>
                <p>A REST API (Application Programming Interface) is an implementation of the principles of REST that
                    provides a set of rules for building web services. RESTful APIs enable communication and data
                    exchange between different software systems over the internet. <br>Resources are identified by URIs
                    (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and they can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods
                    (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Resources represent entities such as objects, data, or services.
                    <br>Commonly used HTTP methods and status codes are integral to the functioning of RESTful APIs.
